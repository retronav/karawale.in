    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student pursuing a degree in computer engineering. As a self-taught
      developer, my work usually involves developing websites, APIs, terminal
      utilities. I don't have a favorite programming language as of now, but the
      most used ones are TypeScript, Go and Python. I also occassionally
      contribute to open source. Learning some machine learning and Rust has
      always been on my bucket list, but I never really got close to it.
      Hopefully soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      My accolades regarding programming include winning a gold medal under the
      skill "Web Technologies" at
      <a href="https://worldskillsindia.co.in/indiaskillsjunior/"
        >JuniorSkills 2021</a
      >, a skill competition conducted all over India.
    </p>

      Besides computers, I have a lot of other interests. I watch a lot of
      football and basketball. For football, I am an avid supporter of
      Manchester United FC. For basketball, I'm a casual and watch the NBA. I am
      a decent player at both the sports. One of the things I'm working on is to
      be able to dunk a basketball.
    </p>

      My favorite artists keep changing, but Ed Sheeran and Eminem have been a
      staple of my music collection for a long time. I also like listening to
      old Bollywood songs ('90s and '00s). I am always on the look for indie
      music creators and would love to listen to some. Even though I am a
      terrible chess player, I enjoy keeping tabs on what's happening in the
      chess world.
